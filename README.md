# Title of the Project: 
Centralized Lecture Hall Live Occupancy Tracker cum Attendance Recorder

# PROJECT ABSTRACT:
The allotment of lecture halls for the conduction of lectures is currently underorganized and a constant source of daily hassle for students as well as professors. There have been countless instances of classes having had to be cancelled or delayed as a result of untimely and unforeseen changes in the venue or time of scheduled lectures.
The daily classroom attendance is time-consuming and compromises the total time available for the lecture.

# AIM:
This project aims to address the aforementioned problems of the students, faculty, and administration in general.

# DESCRIPTION:
The project essentially comprises a centralized web portal that hosts the live occupancy status of the lecture hall at any given time.
Our website implements this functionality by recording the details of the students (i.e., Name, Roll no., Department, Semester, and Institute Email id) and the concerned Professor using their unique identification card, entering the lecture hall within a given time frame.
The web infrastructure used in the project uses this recorded data to update the live status of the lecture hall on the web portal. The status contains â€“ the number of Students, Professor Name, Course, and Occupancy status.
This will be of immense use to students as it will provide a quick reference of the venue of the current lecture hall. Secondly, this portal can also be used by the administration in its task of allotting lecture halls for the conduction of classes. This project will also enable an auto-attendance registry for ongoing lectures, thus preventing the loss of potential lecture time.
